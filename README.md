## ⚡ Why This Project?
**SmartPaeds accelerates junior practitioner proficiency by instantly converting theoretical calculations into discrete, clinically usable units (e.g., 5 mL, 0.5 tablet).**

## 🛠 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Smart Dosing Algorithm 
* **Beyond Simple Math**: The app doesn't just calculate `10.41 mg`. It snaps results to clinically practical increments (e.g. **0.25, 0.5 tablets**) using a custom grid system.
* **Formulation Aware**: Automatically handles rounding logic differently for **Liquid medicine (mL)** vs **Pills**.

### 2. 🛡️ Real-time Safety Auditing
* **Duplicate Detection**: The system scans active ingredients in real-time. If you select *Anti-phen* and *Acetal* (both Acetaminophen), it instantly triggers a visual alert to prevent overdose.
* **Max Dose Protection**: Hard-coded safety caps ensure calculated doses never exceed adult maximums.

### 3. 💾 Workflow Efficiency 
* **State Management**: Utilises **LocalStorage API** to persist prescription data across browser sessions.
* **Use Case**: Allows users to save frequently used drug combinations (e.g. Common Cold bundle), significantly reducing manual search time for routine cases.

### 4. 📱 Responsive & Resilient Architecture
* **Adaptive Layout**: Fully responsive design ensuring a user-friendly experience on both **Desktop (landscape)** and **Mobile (portrait)** devices.
* **Offline-First**: Implements a robust fallback mechanism. If the live JSON fetch fails, it switches to embedded `BACKUP_DATA` to guarantee 100% uptime.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: HTML5,Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
* **Data**: JSON (Relational Data Modeling)
* **Tools**: SortableJS (Drag & Drop Interface)
